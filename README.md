# Regression Project – Predicting Average Temperature

## Requirements
All required Python libraries are listed in `requirements.txt`.  
To install them, run:
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Project Aim
The aim of this project was to analyze and predict average temperature using agricultural and environmental data.  
The dataset was provided by the FAO and IPCC.  
The goal was to understand how activities in the agri-food sector influence temperature and climate.

## Steps Taken
1. Loaded and cleaned the dataset  
2. Renamed columns for easier use  
3. Handled missing values  
4. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
5. Trained and tested three regression models  
6. Compared the model results and selected the best one

## Models Used
- Linear Regression  
- Ridge Regression  
- Random Forest Regressor

## Model Results
Linear Regression  →  R²: 0.516,  MAE: 0.285,  RMSE: 0.385  
Ridge Regression   →  R²: 0.517,  MAE: 0.286,  RMSE: 0.385  
Random Forest      →  R²: 0.640,  MAE: 0.244,  RMSE: 0.332  

The **Random Forest** model performed best with the highest R² and lowest errors.
